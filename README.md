# 👩‍💻 Srushti Arekar - RPA UiPath Portfolio

This repository showcases some of the UiPath automation projects I have built while transitioning into RPA.

## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 [RPA Project – Dynamic Form Data Entry](https://github.com/SrushtiArekar/UiPath-Portfolio/tree/main/RPAChallenge)

A UiPath automation project that reads structured data from an Excel file and submits it into the dynamic web form at [rpachallenge.com](https://rpachallenge.com/).

**Key Highlights:**
- 
✅ Reads data row by row from Excel  
✅ Uses `Anchor Base` to dynamically identify form fields  
✅ Handles randomly changing field order on the form  
✅ Submits each form and loops through all Excel rows  
✅ Built using `Type Into`, `Click`, `For Each Row`, and `Anchor Base` activities  

**Technologies:** UiPath Studio, Excel Activities, UIAutomation, DataTables  
**Input:** `RPAChallenge.xlsx`  
**Output:** Successful submission of all data rows on the website

An advanced UiPath project implementing the RPA Challenge using **REFramework**, **Orchestrator Queues**, and **Assets**.

**Key Highlights:**
- 
✅ Uses Queue-based transaction processing  
✅ Assets-driven configuration for file path and URL  
✅ Dynamic field mapping using `Anchor Base`  
✅ Robust error handling with retry, logging, exception screens  
✅ Fully aligned with enterprise UiPath best practices

### 🔹 [REFramework Project – Accrual Journal Entry Automation in JD Edwards](https://github.com/SrushtiArekar/UiPath-Portfolio/tree/main/RPA_JDEdwards_REFramework)

An enterprise-grade automation using UiPath REFramework that **reads data from an Accrual Excel file** and **performs end-to-end Journal Entry** posting **in JD Edwards EnterpriseOne**. The automation **retrieves the generated Batch Number**, **prepares a consolidated PDF report**, and **delivers it to stakeholders via email**.

**Key Highlights:**
- 
✅ Reads line-wise transactional data from Accrual Excel input  
✅ Uses Assets to configure input file path and JD Edwards URL  
✅ Pushes each row as a Queue Item to Orchestrator Queues  
✅ Leverages REFramework for robust, retry-safe transaction processing  
✅ Automates the JD Edwards menu navigation and opens the Journal Entry form  
✅ Enters data into the grid line by line to create journal entries  
✅ Extracts the Batch Number once the transaction is submitted  
✅ Executes General Journal by Batch Report using the Batch Number  
✅ Downloads the generated report in PDF format  
✅ Converts the Accrual Excel into a PDF  
✅ Merges Accrual PDF + JD Edwards Report to form a final consolidated document  
✅ Sends the final report to designated stakeholders via email  
✅ Gracefully handles System and Business Exceptions using REFramework best practices  

**Technologies:** UiPath REFramework, Orchestrator Queues, Assets, Excel Activities, UI Automation, JD Edwards ERP, PDF Activities, Email Automation  
**Input:** Accrual_Report Excel File  
**Output:** Journal Entry Posted in JD Edwards + Final Report (PDF) emailed to stakeholders
