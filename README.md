## üìÅ Projects

### üîπ [RPAChallenge1 ‚Äì Dynamic Form Data Entry](https://github.com/SrushtiArekar/UiPath-Portfolio/tree/main/RPAChallenge)

A UiPath automation project that reads structured data from an Excel file and submits it into the dynamic web form at [rpachallenge.com](https://rpachallenge.com/).

**Key Highlights:**
- Reads data row by row from Excel
- Uses `Anchor Base` to dynamically identify form fields
- Handles randomly changing field order on the form
- Submits each form and loops through all Excel rows

**Technologies:** UiPath Studio, Excel Activities, UIAutomation, DataTables  
**Input:** `RPAChallenge.xlsx`

An advanced UiPath project implementing the RPA Challenge using **REFramework**, **Orchestrator Queues**, and **Assets**.

**Key Highlights:**
- Uses Queue-based transaction processing
- Assets-driven configuration for file path and URL
- Dynamic field mapping using `Anchor Base`
- Robust error handling with retry, logging, exception screens
- Fully aligned with enterprise UiPath best practices

**Technologies:** REFramework, Orchestrator Queues, Assets, Excel Activities, UI Automation
