This repository showcases some of the UiPath automation projects I have built while transitioning into RPA.

## üìÅ Projects

### üîπ [RPAChallenge1 ‚Äì Dynamic Form Data Entry](https://github.com/your-username/RPAChallenge1)

A UiPath automation project that reads structured data from an Excel file and submits it into the dynamic web form at [rpachallenge.com](https://rpachallenge.com/).

**Key Highlights:**
- Reads data row by row from Excel
- Uses `Anchor Base` to dynamically identify form fields
- Handles randomly changing field order on the form
- Submits each form and loops through all Excel rows
- Built using `Type Into`, `Click`, `For Each Row`, and `Anchor Base` activities

**Technologies:** UiPath Studio, Excel Activities, UIAutomation, DataTables  
**Input:** `RPAChallenge.xlsx`  
**Output:** Successful submission of all data rows on the website
