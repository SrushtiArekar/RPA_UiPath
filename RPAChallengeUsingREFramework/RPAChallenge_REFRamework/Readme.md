# 🤖 RPA Challenge Performer – REFramework | UiPath

This project is the **Performer** component of the **RPA Challenge** implemented using **UiPath’s REFramework**. It reads data from **Orchestrator Queues**, enters each row into the RPA Challenge web form, and handles exceptions and retry mechanisms gracefully.

---

## 🧠 REFramework — Robotic Enterprise Framework
The Robotic Enterprise Framework (REFramework) is a robust, scalable, and reusable automation framework built using UiPath’s State Machine architecture. It is ideal for transactional business processes and provides a standard template to handle initialization, transaction processing, exception handling, and application cleanup—with built-in support for Orchestrator Queues and enhanced logging.

## 🚀 Key Features
✅ Based on Transactional Business Process template
🧩 Implements State Machine for modular control flow
🔐 Securely retrieves credentials from Orchestrator Assets or Windows Credential Manager
⚙️ Stores dynamic settings in Config.xlsx and environment-specific assets
📦 Handles Orchestrator Queue items and updates their transaction statuses
📸 Captures screenshots for system exceptions to aid debugging
📑 Provides detailed logs for traceability and auditing

## 🔄 Workflow Phases
## 1️⃣ Initialization Phase
**Workflow	Description**
```vb InitAllSettings.xaml```	Loads configuration data from Config.xlsx and Orchestrator assets
```vb GetAppCredential.xaml```	Retrieves credentials from secure stores
```vb InitAllApplications.xaml```	Launches and logs in to required applications

## 2️⃣ Transaction Retrieval
**Workflow	Description**
GetTransactionData.xaml	Fetches transaction items from Orchestrator Queue or other sources via Config("OrchestratorQueueName")

## 3️⃣ Transaction Processing
**Workflow	Description**
Process.xaml	Main business logic — processes each transaction and invokes sub-workflows
SetTransactionStatus.xaml	Updates the transaction status in Orchestrator (Success, Business Exception, System Exception)

## 4️⃣ Closure Phase
**Workflow	Description**
CloseAllApplications.xaml	Logs out and gracefully closes all used applications

## 🧰 Setting Up a New REFramework Project
Customize Config.xlsx

Add application paths, URLs, credentials, queue names, and other constants

Implement Application Initialization & Cleanup

Update InitAllApplications.xaml and CloseAllApplications.xaml to suit your process

Adapt Transaction Logic

Modify GetTransactionData.xaml and SetTransactionStatus.xaml if you're not using Orchestrator queues

Develop Process Logic

Design the core automation steps inside Process.xaml

Reuse or modularize using Invoke Workflow activities

🛡️ Exception Handling & Logging
REFramework includes:

Global try-catch in each state

Retry logic for system exceptions

Detailed logging using Log Message activities

Automatic screenshot capture on system failure (saved in /Exceptions_Screenshots)

> 💡 This is the Performer part of the full REFramework solution. The Dispatcher (linked below) is responsible for uploading data to the queue.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Uses **UiPath REFramework** with minor modifications for queue-based input
- Reads `TransactionItem` of type `QueueItem`
- Extracts SpecificContent from each queue item
- Navigates to the [RPA Challenge website](https://www.rpachallenge.com/)
- Fills out the form with all the required fields
- Submits the form and proceeds with the next item

---

## 📂 Project Contents

- `Main.xaml` – REFramework entry point
- `InitAllSettings.xaml` – Initializes config
- `GetTransactionData.xaml` – Fetches next queue item
- `Process.xaml` – Main logic to fill and submit the form
- `ExceptionHandler.xaml` – Handles errors and retries
- `Config.xlsx` – Configuration file

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Run the [Dispatcher](https://github.com/SrushtiArekar/UiPath-Portfolio/tree/main/RPAChallengeUsingREFramework/RPAChallengeREFrameworkDispatcher) project to upload queue items to `RPAChallengeREFrameworkQueue`.
2. In UiPath Orchestrator:
   - Ensure assets like URL, credentials (if needed), etc. are defined.
3. Open this Performer project in UiPath Studio.
4. Run `Main.xaml`.
5. Watch as it loops through the queue, submits the form, and logs the results.
